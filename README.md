The “Invisibility Cloak” project is an exciting exploration into the world of computer vision and image processing. Inspired by the magical invisibility cloaks from popular fiction, this project uses OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python, to create an illusion of invisibility. By leveraging color detection and background subtraction techniques, the project seamlessly blends parts of the frame with a pre-captured background, making the cloak wearer appear invisible.
